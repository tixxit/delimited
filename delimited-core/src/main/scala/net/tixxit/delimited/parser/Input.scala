/**
 * An immutable window into a stream of character data. The size of the window
 * is determined by 2 methods: `marked(pos)` and `append(chunk)`, which shrink
 * and expand the window respectively. All positions used with `Input` are
 * always relative to the entire stream, though only positions within the
 * current window are valid at any given point in time.
 *
 * The method `marked` returns a new `Input` which may drop all data before the
 * marked position. Accessing data before the marked position in the returned
 * `Input` is undefined and should be expected to fail in hilarious ways.
 *
 * The method `append` is used to append new chunks of data from the stream
 * onto the input. The `Input` returned by `append` will have all its data
 * up-to `mark` removed.
 *
 * @param offset the offset, in chars, of the start of `data` in the stream
 * @param data   the currently readable window into the stream
 * @param isLast true if this window covers the end of the stream
 * @param mark   the position in the stream we are able to truncate data to
